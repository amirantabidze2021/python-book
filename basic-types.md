# Basic Types, part 1

> In this chapter we'll learn about main aspects of Python basic types such as numbers and strings, how to work with them, their methods and attributes, and also - \(which is very important to know from the beginning\) how to read help and do basic introspection of any object.
>
> In the next chapter \(part 2\) we'll continue to learn about basic types - such as lists, tuples, dicts and also how to loop through sequences, create conditions etc.
