# None {#None-2}

> `None`means empty object.



In Python there is one and only such an object \(so called singleton\). It is returned by functions that don't`return`anything specifically. Also it used as argument value for passing to a function to mark empty list of parameters.

`None`doesn't have attributes and in boolean operations is being treated as`False`.
