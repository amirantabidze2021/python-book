# None

> `None` means empty object. In Python there is one and only such an object (singleton). 

`None` is used in this cases:
* It is default return value of all functions. So if don't explicitly specify `return` in the function it will return `None`.
* Also it used as argument value for passing to a function to mark empty list (or other mutable). 

Also, it worth to note that `None` doesn't have attributes and in boolean operations is being treated as `False`.
