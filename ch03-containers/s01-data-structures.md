### Data Structures

> This is a super short intro in Data structures

There are two main basic data structures:
* **Linked list**
    * a linear collection of data elements, whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory. Instead, each element points to the next.

* **Array**
    * a systematic arrangement of similar objects. Array has a fixed length and a type of members.

On top of these - two very important and widely used non-primitive data sctructures are built:

* **Stack**
    * *FILO* (First In Last Out) or *LIFO* (Last In First Out) data structure, which means the item which is inserted last is retrieved first.
* **Queue**
    * FIFO (First In First Out) data structure, i.e. object which is first inserted, is first consumed.
