# Data Structures

> This is a super short intro in Data structures

There are two main basic data structures:

* **Linked list**
  *   a linear collection of data elements, whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory. Instead, each element points to the next.

* **Array**
  *   a systematic arrangement of similar objects. Array has a fixed length and a type of members.

On top of these - two very important and widely used non-primitive data sctructures are built:

* **Stack**
  * _FILO_ (First In Last Out) or _LIFO_ (Last In First Out) data structure, which means the item which is inserted last is retrieved first.
* **Queue**
  * FIFO (First In First Out) data structure, i.e. object which is first inserted, is first consumed.
