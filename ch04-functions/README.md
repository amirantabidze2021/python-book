> This chapter describes functions in Python - how to create, use them, process passed parameters. Also it covers scopes of visibility, lambdas (anonymous functions), generators and some additional topics like functions internals and closures.

## Plan:

* [Functions](s01-functions.md)
* [Scopes of visibility](s02-scopes-of-visibility.md)
* [Generators](s03-generators.md)
* [Lambdas](s04-lambdas.md)
* [Function internals](s05-function-internals.md)
* [Sources for self-learning](s06-sources-for-self-learning.md)
