# 9. Testing

> The goal of this chapter is covering basic ideas of how testing is done in Python. Few main test frameworks discussed - doctest (for small projects) and unittest (xUnit/jUnit clone for medium and bigger sized projects).

## Plan:

* [Basic Terminology](s01-basic-terminology.md)
* [Testing theory](s02-testing-theory.md)
* [Dev unit testing vs QA automated testing](s03-dev-unit-testing-vs-qa-automated-testing.md)
* [Best Practices](s04-best-practices.md)
* [Doctest](s05-doctest.md)
* [Unittest](s06-unittest.md)
* [Test Runners](s07-test-runners.md)
* [Pytest](s08-pytest.md)
* [Nose](s09-nose.md)
* [Continuous Integration](s10-continuous-integration.md)
