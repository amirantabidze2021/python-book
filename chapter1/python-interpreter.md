# Python interpreter

> Interpreter - mean it runs code almost "live"

* Downloadable from [http://python.org](http://python.org)
* Python is script language but still it compiles runtime code in a form of so called bytecode which Python Virtual Machine \(PVM\) runs \(just like Java does with it's JVM\):

* Compiled code is auto-created and stored in .pyc files \(for Python 3 they are in separate \_\_pycache\_\_ directory\)
