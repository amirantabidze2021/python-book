# OOP basics

> OOP (Object oriented Programming) - programming paradigm where all operations are based on manipulations on abstract objects which has internal state and support methods that query or modify this internal state in some way.

Pythonâ€™s class mechanism adds classes with a minimum of new syntax and semantics. 

Python classes provide all the standard features of Object Oriented Programming: the class inheritance mechanism allows multiple base classes, a derived class can override any methods of its base class or classes, and a method can call the method of a base class with the same name. Objects can contain arbitrary amounts and kinds of data. As is true for modules, classes partake of the dynamic nature of Python: they are created at runtime, and can be modified further after creation.

Main OOP terms:
* Classes, objects/instances
* Methods
* Instantiation
* Inheritance
* Method overloading

## OOP mini glossary

* **Class**
    * "An idea" of object, some pattern
    * A user-defined prototype for an object that defines a set of attributes that characterize any object of the class.
    * Logical group of data (attributes) and functions (referred to as "methods" when defined within a class)
   
* **Instance**
    * An individual object of a certain class.

* **Method**:
    * A special kind of function that is defined in a class definition.

* **Inheritance**: 
    * Passing attributes and methods of a parent class to instance or child class

* **Method overloading**: 
    * The assignment of more than one behavior to a particular method

## 4 principles of OOP

* Encapsulation
* Data Abstraction
* Inheritance
* Polymorphism

### Encapsulation 

* A language mechanism for restricting direct access to some of the object's components.
* A language construct that facilitates the bundling of data with the methods (or other functions) operating on that data.

### Data Abstraction

Abstraction is a technique for managing complexity of computer systems. It works by establishing a level of complexity on which a person interacts with the system, suppressing the more complex details below the current level.

### Inheritance

Inheritance is a way to reuse code of existing objects, or to establish a subtype from an existing object, or both, depending upon programming language support. In classical inheritance where objects are defined by classes, classes can inherit attributes and behavior from pre-existing classes called base classes, superclasses, parent classes or ancestor classes. 

### Polymorphism

Polymorphism means one name, many forms. Polymorphism manifests itself by having multiple methods all with the same name, but slightly different functionality.

There are 2 basic types of polymorphism.
Overridding, also called run-time polymorphism. For method overloading, the compiler determines which method will be executed, and this decision is made when the code gets compiled.
Overloading, which is referred to as compile-time polymorphism. Method will be used for method overriding is determined at runtime based on the dynamic type of an object.
