# Testing

> The goal of this chapter is covering basic ideas of how testing is done in Python. Few main test frameworks discussed - `doctest` \(for small projects\) and `unittest` \(xUnit/jUnit clone for medium and bigger sized projects\).  
> Also it talks about Jenkins, contunius integration and testing theory overall.

* [Unittest](/testing/unittest.md)
* [Continiuos integration](/testing/continiuos-integration.md)
* [Sources for self-learning](/testing/sources-for-self-learning.md)
