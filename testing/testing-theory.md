# Testing theory

> Manual testing is the process through which software developers run tests manually, comparing program expectations and actual outcomes in order to find software defects.

> Automated testing is the process through which automated testing tools run tests that repeat predefined actions, comparing a developing programâ€™s expected and actual outcomes

Why do we need automated testing?
* to allow for later changes
* to raise confidence that code works
* to specify and document behaviour
* collaborative and faster development cycles

Levels of testing:
* `unittest`: 
    * units react well to input.
* `integration`: 
    * components co-operate nicely
* `system`: 
    * everything altogether is working OK
* `acceptance`:
    * full system on production

Types of testing:
* functional
* security
* UI
* usability
* performance 
* etc..

What is the job of automated testing tools?
* verify code changes work out
* be helpful when tests fail
